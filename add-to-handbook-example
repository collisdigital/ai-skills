Add to this handbook the preference (SHOULD) for squashing commits in Git before merging to the trunk,
explain why this is preferred and give example code blocks for how to rewrite history and guidance for
what commits to keep vs. squash etc. Find the most appropriate place in the handbook for this, I suggest
somewhere under `doc/using-source-control/` either a new page or part of an existing one if that makes
more sense. If a new page is added, it will need to be added to the `zensical.toml` navigation.
